#Udacity Neighborhood Map

This map is my final project for Udacity's Front-End Web Development Nanodegree. The goal was to create a map using Knockout, Google Maps API & FourSquare API. 

## Run App

* Click [here](https://nicoleirene.github.io/UdacityNeighborhoodMap/) to see my Queens NY Neighborhood Map  

## Components

 * Downloaded the Knockout framework to handle the list, filter, tracking click events on list items and any other information on the page that is subject to changing state.

* Wrote code required to add a full-screen map to a page by
 by first using the Google Maps API key and then adding additional third party (Foursquare) APIs for map marker list entry information.

 * Added functionality to animate a map marker (bounce) when either the list item associated with it or the map marker itself is selected.

 * Added functionality to open an infoWindow with third party information

 * App's interface is intuitive to use. For example, the input text area to filter locations is easy to locate.
